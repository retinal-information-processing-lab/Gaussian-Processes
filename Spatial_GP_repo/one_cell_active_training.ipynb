    "### What is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose initial training points to be considered a random set of images to present to the retina. \n",
    "\n",
    "We fit a complete GP with ntilde=ntrain on those. This will be our starting fit / our starting model\n",
    "\n",
    "From the starting fit, we start two different closed loop fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Active loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We add the most useful images one at the time, each time recomputing the fit, until we reach the maximum amount of images that we want to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each model fit we estimate the loglikelihood predicted on a test set. This us fixed in this notebook, like the starting ntrain is.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Random loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We add a random image one ad the time and compute the fit, also estimating the predicted likelihood each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differently than the active loop, we do so many times (~10) to obtain an everage trend of how fast the model is learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "This trend was fixed for the active loop once the starting inducing points have been fixed, that's why we only did one repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the dataset and create a total training set X,R\n",
    "2. Pick the cell and the initial training points, extracted randomly. These correspond also to the number of inducing points\n",
    "3. Estimate the utility of each image that was not used to train\n",
    "4. Add that image to the training set for the nxt iteration\n",
